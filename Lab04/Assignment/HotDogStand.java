 * Suppose you operate several hot dog stands distributed throughout town. Define an 
    Encapsulated class named HotDogStand that has an instance variable for the hot dog standâ€™s 
    ID number and an instance variable for how many hot dogs the stand has sold that day.
    Create a constructor that allows a user of the class to initialize both values. Also create a 
    method named justSold that increments by one the number of hot dogs the stand has sold. 
    The idea is that this method will be invoked each time the stand sells a hot dog so that you 
    can track the total number of hot dogs sold by the stand.
